# Sports Object Detection with YOLOv5

## **Abstract**
This project uses the YOLOv5 model, trained on the COCO dataset, to detect and classify sports objects like balls, tennis rackets, and skateboards. It integrates a Tkinter-based GUI to display pop-up notifications and object names when detected, achieving high accuracy and practical applications in sports analytics and image understanding.
